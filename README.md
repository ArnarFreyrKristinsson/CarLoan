# Car Loan Calculator

A .NET 8 car loan calculation system built around composable business rules.

## What It Does

Validates loan applications against a set of independent business rules and calculates monthly payments when conditions are met.

**Validation rules:**

| Rule | Description |
|---|---|
| `MinimumLoanAmountValidator` | Loan amount must be at least 750,000 |
| `MinimumDownPaymentValidator` | Down payment must be at least 150,000 |
| `MinimumLoanPeriodValidator` | Loan period must be at least 6 months |
| `MaximumLoanPeriodValidator` | Enforces maximum loan ratio (90%), maximum period (84 months), and stricter limits for used cars (80% ratio / 72 months) |

**Calculation:**

`LoanCalculator` computes the monthly payment from a set of `LoanTerms` using the standard amortization formula.

## How It's Built

- **Specification Pattern** — each loan rule is its own class implementing `ILoanValidator` with an `Evaluate` method that returns a `LoanRuleResult`
- **Dependency Injection** — rules are registered in .NET's built-in DI container and injected as `IEnumerable<ILoanValidator>`, so the `LoanValidator` never knows which rules exist
- **TDD** — built test-first using xUnit with Osherove naming conventions (`MethodName_ExpectedResult_StateUnderTest`), following red-green-refactor
- **SOLID** — Open/Closed Principle in practice: new rules are new classes, existing code stays untouched

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ArnarFreyrKristinsson/CarLoan.git
cd CarLoan

# Build
dotnet build

# Run tests
dotnet test
```

## Why This Architecture

The project demonstrates how to handle business logic that changes frequently. When a rule changes, you change one class. When a new rule is added, you add one class and register it. Nothing else moves. The test suite verifies each rule in isolation, so you know exactly what broke and why.
